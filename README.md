## BJKST (F0)
__Determination of maximum bucket size__

The maximum bucket size $|B|$ is determined by a constant $c$ and parameter $\varepsilon$ according to $|B| = \frac{c}{\varepsilon^2}$ and outputs a $(\varepsilon, \frac{1}{3})$ estimate. We are attempting to find a $\pm$ 20% estimate so $\varepsilon=0.2$. To determine $c$ we use the relation $$\mathbb{P}(\text{Failure}) \leq \frac{1}{12} +\frac{48}{c}$$ which is derived by using Chebyshev's inequality and Markov's inequality ([Chkrabarti Notes](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ac/Teach/data-streams-lecnotes.pdf), pg. 19.). For a $(\varepsilon, \frac{1}{3})$ estimate this probability must be upper bounded by $\frac{1}{6}$, therefore $$\mathbb{P}(\text{Failure}) \leq \frac{1}{12} +\frac{48}{c} \leq \frac{1}{6}$$ Solving this numerically yields a result of $c \geq 576$. Plugging into $\frac{c}{\varepsilon^2}$ yields $\boxed{14,400}$ for the maximum bucket with.

## Comparison of algorithms
We will first discuss the accuracy of the estimates by taking the values from running each function locally. 
| | True value | Estimated | Error of estimation ($\pm$%) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| F0 | 7406649 | 7921664 | 6.5  |
| F2 | 8567966130 | 6764401820 | 21 |

From the analysis of the median-of-means approach for the Tug-of-War algorithm we know the number of trials for each mean is calculated according to $$k=\frac{6}{\varepsilon^2}$$ By manually setting the number of trials to be $k=10$ we are outputting a $\varepsilon \approx 0.77$ estimate (which is not good). Similarly the probability of getting an $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ estimate is bounded by $$t = 10 \log{\frac{1}{\delta}}$$ Again by manually setting $t=3$ we are outputting a $\varepsilon \approx 0.77$ estimate with probability $1-\delta \approx 0.26$. We find an estimate of $F_2$ that only deviates by $\varepsilon = 0.21$ so we can be confident that our algorithm works.

For the BJKST algorithm we have already discussed how we can ensure a $\varepsilon = 0.2$ estimate. We take $t=5$ so by the same approach we estimate a $\varepsilon =0.2$ estimate with probability $1-\delta \approx 0.394$. Given that our estimate only deviated by 6.5% we can be confident our algorithm works.

__NOW TALK ABOUT SPEEDUP__

## Calculating and reporting your findings
You'll be submitting a report along with your code that provides commentary on the tasks below.  

1. **(3 points)** Implement the `exact_F2` function. The function accepts an RDD of strings as an input. The output should be exactly `F2 = sum(Fs^2)`, where `Fs` is the number of occurrences of plate `s` and the sum is taken over all plates. This can be achieved in one line using the `map` and `reduceByKey` methods of the RDD class. Run `exact_F2` locally **and** on GCP with 1 driver and 4 machines having 2 x N1 cores. Copy the results to your report. Terminate the program if it runs for longer than 30 minutes.
2. **(3 points)** Implement the `Tug_of_War` function. The function accepts an RDD of strings, a parameter `width`, and a parameter `depth` as inputs. It should run `width * depth` Tug-of-War sketches, group the outcomes into groups of size `width`, compute the means of each group, and then return the median of the `depth` means in approximating F2. A 4-universal hash function class `four_universal_Radamacher_hash_function`, which generates a hash function from a 4-universal family, has been provided for you. The generated function `hash(s: String)` will hash a string to 1 or -1, each with a probability of 50%. Once you've implemented the function, set `width` to 10 and `depth` to 3. Run `Tug_of_War` locally **and** on GCP with 1 driver and 4 machines having 2 x N1 cores. Copy the results to your report. Terminate the program if it runs for longer than 30 minutes. **Please note** that the algorithm won't be significantly faster than `exact_F2` since the number of different cars is not large enough for the memory to become a bottleneck. Additionally, computing `width * depth` hash values of the license plate strings requires considerable overhead. That being said, executing with `width = 1` and `depth = 1` should generally still be faster.
3. **(3 points)** Implement the `BJKST` function. The function accepts an RDD of strings, a parameter `width`, and a parameter `trials` as inputs. `width` denotes the maximum bucket size of each sketch. The function should run `trials` sketches and return the median of the estimates of the sketches. A template of the `BJKSTSketch` class is also included in the sample code. You are welcome to finish its methods and apply that class or write your own class from scratch. A 2-universal hash function class `hash_function(numBuckets_in: Long)` has also been provided and will hash a string to an integer in the range `[0, numBuckets_in - 1]`. Once you've implemented the function, determine the smallest `width` required in order to achieve an error of +/- 20% on your estimate. Keeping `width` at that value, set `depth` to 5. Run `BJKST` locally **and** on GCP with 1 driver and 4 machines having 2 x N1 cores. Copy the results to your report. Terminate the program if it runs for longer than 30 minutes.
4. **(1 point)** Compare the BJKST algorithm to the exact F0 algorithm and the tug-of-war algorithm to the exact F2 algorithm. Summarize your findings.
